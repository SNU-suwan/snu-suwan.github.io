      <h3>Assistant Professor, AIDA Lab</h3>
      <p>
        Starting on <time datetime="2025-09-01">1&nbsp;September&nbsp;2025</time>, our principal investigator joins the
        <strong>Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Kyung Hee University</strong> as an Assistant Professor.
        They lead the AI‑aided Design Automation (AIDA) Lab and are passionate about merging artificial intelligence with
        automated design processes.  Their research interests span generative design, machine‑learning based optimisation,
        electronic design automation and interactive human–AI collaboration in engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before joining Kyung Hee University, our PI completed a Ph.D. focused on AI‑driven design automation and
        subsequently held research positions in academia and industry.  They have published papers in major conferences and
        journals on topics ranging from generative models for CAD to hardware‑accelerated design tools.  They are
        committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive research environment, mentoring students and pushing the
        boundaries of AI‑driven design.
