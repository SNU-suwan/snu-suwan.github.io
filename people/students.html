    <h2>Students</h2>
    <p>
      The AIDA Lab is a newly established group and we are currently recruiting passionate and talented students at all levels (undergraduate interns, master’s and doctoral candidates) who are interested in artificial intelligence and design automation.  Our research sits at the intersection of machine learning, optimisation and CAD/EDA, and we welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds including computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are excited about developing generative design algorithms, building intelligent design tools or exploring AI for engineering, we encourage you to reach out.  We value creativity, curiosity and a willingness to learn.  To express your interest, please consult our <a href="../apply.html">Apply/Contact</a> page for instructions on how to get in touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lab grows, this page will showcase profiles of our team members, their research interests and their contributions.  Stay tuned!
