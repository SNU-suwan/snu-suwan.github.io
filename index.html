    <h2>About the Lab</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>AI‑aided Design Automation (AIDA) Lab</strong> is a research group at <em>Kyung Hee University</em> in Seoul, South Korea.
      We focus on the confluence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automated design processes. 
	  Our mission is to build intelligent systems that automate and accelerate the semiconductor design process. 
	  By harnessing intelligent algorithms, we aim to reduce design cycles and empower engineers and designers with novel creative tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field of <em>AI‑aided design automation</em> is growing rapidly. 
	  Recent research explores integrating machine learning into electronic design automation (EDA) workflows and using generative models to create design variations that meet specified constraints. These efforts inspire our lab to pursue similar innovations, adapting them to a wide range of design domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to algorithm development, we are passionate about bridging theory and application. Our collaborations span academia and industry, aiming to translate state‑of‑the‑art research into practical tools that can be used in real‑world design environments.
