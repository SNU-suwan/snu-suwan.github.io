    <h2>About the Lab</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>AI‑aided Design Automation (AIDA) Lab</strong> is a new research group at <em>Kyung Hee University</em> in Seoul, South Korea.
      Beginning on <time datetime="2025-09-01">1&nbsp;September&nbsp;2025</time>, we focus on the confluence of
      artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automated design processes.  Our mission is to build intelligent systems that automate and accelerate the design of complex products – from electronic circuits and mechanical components to architectural structures and
      beyond.  By harnessing data‑driven models and generative algorithms, we aim to reduce design cycles and empower engineers and designers with novel creative tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field of <em>AI‑aided design automation</em> is growing rapidly.  Recent research has explored integrating
      machine learning into electronic design automation (EDA) workflows and using generative models to create design variations that meet specified constraints.  For example, work at the University of Rhode Island has highlighted projects such as hardware‑accelerated
      machine‑learning aided design tools and machine‑learning based design optimization【86325014122364†L51-L76】.  These efforts inspire our lab to pursue similar innovations, adapting them to a wide range of design domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to algorithm development, we are passionate about bridging theory and application.  Our collaborations span academia and industry, aiming to translate state‑of‑the‑art research into practical tools that can be used in real‑world design environments.

          <h3>Generative Design</h3>
          <p>We develop generative models that can automatically propose diverse design alternatives.  Generative AI studies patterns in data and learns to create new designs similar to the examples it has seen【685440112580855†L160-L168】, enabling rapid exploration of the design space.</p>
